# Four in a Row

A simple ["Connect Four"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game implemented using React and Redux.

Live example: https://aigyptios.github.io/four-in-a-row/

Players take turns adding their tokens to the grid until four tokens of the same color connect in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player of the color of the connected tokens wins.

## Work

The implementation was written in around 4-5 hours (not in one direct sitting). Tests were written after the initial time ( ðŸ˜…) as well as this README and the github pages site associated with this repository.

## To do

- More code coverage
- ~~Implement a "game won" detection algorithm~~
- More mobile friendly
- Consider refactoring state property `winner` into broader/more robust `gameStatus`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
